# Digit Recognizer 91.4% accuracy
This is my attempt at the famous digit recognizer using machine learning concepts implement using numpy and pandas. I managed to get an accuracy of 91.4% some pre-processing, such as data regularization, and efficient coding practices.
The notebook is also on kaggle if you want to run it and make changes of your own. Heres the link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarmadahmad8/digit-recognizer/notebook
